We often think of pattern matching as secondary--something desugared
by a compiler pass into the fundamental connectives of the type theory
(logic, etc.) via elaboration into usages of projections,
let-elimination, etc. This paper asks: what if we wanted to build
pattern matching into the rules of the type theory? However, there is
a more important message in this paper than that superficial
goal. Instead, we can think about the structure of these proof systems
as being operationally-minded, in terms of canonicalizing the proof
search in a very relevant manner.

When we think about a traditional
