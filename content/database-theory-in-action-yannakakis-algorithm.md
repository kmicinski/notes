## Summary

This is a short paper. In mid-January '26, we talked with Remy about Yannakakis' algorithm, 

## Key Contributions

- This is a short paper, mostly just gives a blog-post-style exposition of the ideas.

## Notes

Definition (Join Tree): 

This article makes a very nice example

```
Q = R(i, j) ⋈ S(j, k) ⋈ T (k, l) ⋈ U (l, m)
