  abstract="Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing services provider that has made significant investments in applying formal methods to proving correctness of its internal systems and providing assurance of correctness to their end-users. In this paper, we focus on how we built abstractions and eliminated specifications to scale a verification engine for AWS access policies, Zelkova, to be usable by all AWS users. We present milestones from our journey from a thousand SMT invocations daily to an unprecedented billion SMT calls in a span of five years. In this paper, we talk about how the cloud is enabling application of formal methods, key insights into what made this scale of a billion SMT queries daily possible, and present some open scientific challenges for the formal methods community.",
