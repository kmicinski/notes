    abstract =	 "The general consensus is that disassembly of
                    binaries is undecidable. The cause lies in
                    distinguishing instructions from data, and resolving
                    indirections. Furthermore, binaries can behave in
                    ``weird'' ways which have no counterpart in assembly
                    languages, e.g., instructions may overlap, or use
                    other instructions as data. Yet, the general
                    consensus is that, for a large part of production
                    binaries, disassembly works sufficiently well for
                    the use cases at hand. This paper aims to address
                    the question: for which binaries is disassembly
                    decidable? For which binaries can disassembly become
                    decidable if an external oracle, e.g., provides the
                    set of instruction addresses, or resolves
                    indirections? We present a set of five theorems on
                    decidability of disassembly; each theorem
                    corresponding to a use case. All five theorems are
                    accompanied by a proof of correctness based on
                    bisimilarity between the input binary and the output
                    assembly program, and have been formalized in the
                    Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.",
