  abstract="The IC3 algorithm was recently introduced for proving properties of finite state reactive systems. It has been applied very successfully to hardware model checking. We provide a specification of the algorithm using an abstract transition system and highlight its dual operation: model search and conflict resolution. We then generalize it along two dimensions. Along one dimension we address nonlinear fixed-point operators (push-down systems) and evaluate the algorithm on Boolean programs. In the second dimension we leverage proofs and models and generalize the method to Boolean constraints involving theories.",
