      abstract="ProbLog is a recently introduced probabilistic extension of Prolog. The key contribution of this paper is that we extend ProbLog with abilities to specify continuous distributions and that we show how ProbLog's exact inference mechanism can be modified to cope with such distributions. The resulting inference engine combines an interval calculus with a dynamic discretization algorithm into an effective solver.",
