  abstract = {Software reverse engineering is a challenging and time consuming task. With the growing demand for reverse engineering in vulnerability discovery and malware analysis, manual reverse engineering cannot scale to meet the demand. There has been significant effort to develop automated tooling to support reverse engineers, but many reverse engineers report not using these tools. In this paper, we seek to understand whether this lack of use is an issue of usability. We performed a iterative open coding of 288 reverse engineering tools to identify common input and output methods, as well as whether the tools adhered to usability guidelines established in prior work. We found that most reverse engineering tools have limited interaction and usability support. However, usability issues vary between dynamic and static tools. Dynamic tools were less likely to provide easy-to-use interfaces, while static tools often did not allow reverse engineers to adjust the analysis. Based on our findings, we give recommendations for reverse engineering framework developers and suggest directions for future HCI research in reverse engineering.},
