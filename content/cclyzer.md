  abstract="We present a points-to analysis for C/C++ that recovers much of the available high-level structure information of types and objects, by applying two key techniques: (1) It records the type of each abstract object and, in cases when the type is not readily available, the analysis uses an allocation-site plus type abstraction to create multiple abstract objects per allocation site, so that each one is associated with a single type. (2) It creates separate abstract objects that represent (a) the fields of objects of either struct or class type, and (b) the (statically present) constant indices of arrays, resulting in a limited form of array-sensitivity.",
