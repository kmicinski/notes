# Project Ideas

A collection of project ideas I'm working on or considering.

## Active Projects

### Personal Notes System

Building a minimal note-taking system in Rust. See the detailed sub-note at [@098a5c] for implementation details.

Key requirements:
- Markdown-based with frontmatter
- Cross-linking between notes
- Time tracking built-in
- Git-based version history

## Research Interests

I've been reading about attention mechanisms in neural networks. See my notes on the seminal paper [@3bfb71] for more details.

## Weekly Progress

Check out the weekly log at [@ea2802] for ongoing progress tracking.
